## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After completing this project, what continues to be reinforced is that when I am building these projects with just HTML and CSS, I am keeping in mind to treat each element as a block. To build a good foundation so that when I start using CSS to stylize the HTML, it is much easier to do so.  

### Continued development

I need to do better when it comes to repeating code. That is something I want to think about more in the future. I noticed that I was repeating values for certain properties in the CSS file when I could have put them in some kind of CSS variable. Will keep this in mind in the future.
